Abstract lacks a lot of detail in terms of actual work covered and key results obtained
Lack of new references
Figures and tables need to be referenced in the text
Inconsistent configuration used across queries
Indexing process missed some detail, particularly in document definition and examples (especially given format conversion)
Evaluation metrics lack detail in terms of choices made (e.g., why the first 10 results, how was recall estimated)
No tables documenting top results retrieved (impossible to validate evaluation metrics)
(Some) Precision-recall curves have a wrong pattern
Results discussion has little depth, mostly just reiterates what is shown in metrics tables
